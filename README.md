# ETL4Data: Pipeline for OSM data set
Building ETLs is quite repetitive and data source specific, therefore, we want to provide an off-the-shelf set of ETLs for as many of the data sources listed in Landscape4Data as possible. This will give the user an ability to automate data harvesting and existing data updates

## Set up

1. First create a directory in HDFS, on which user *mapred* has read and write permissions.

Example
```
sudo -u mapred hadoop fs -mkdir example
```
2. Create a directory called *lib* within the recently created directory.

Example
```
sudo -u mapred hadoop fs -mkdir example/lib
```
3. The Oozie workflow works with Java and Hive actions. Copy workflow.xml, job.properties and all hive scripts to 
directory *example* in HDFS.

Example
```
sudo -u mapred hadoop fs -put [file_to_upload] example
```
4. All Java programs must be compiled into jars, and it is recommended that all their dependencies are packaged in the jar as well.
Copy all jars to *example/lib*

5. Copy the hive configuration file hive-site.xml from /etc/hive/conf/hive-site.xml to the directory *example*  in HDFS.
6. To run the Oozie workkflow, execute the following command as mapred user:
```
sudo -u mapred oozie job -oozie [oozie-server_url]/oozie -config [path to job.properties in local file system] -run
```
Example
```
sudo -u mapred oozie job -oozie http://udltest2.cs.ucl.ac.uk:11000/oozie -config [path to job.properties in local file system] -run
```
